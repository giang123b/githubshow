If I have to say some words about my holiday, I would like to bring up with my last trip to a resort which is in Soc Son district.

I travel to the resort with 20 classmates last month. To be honest it’s my memoriable trip because many reasons. The main thing is that I explored many stories of my teammates about their works, life, experience, and so on. I was so excited because people said, software developers are introvert and they are taciturn but they made me laugh out loud during our trip. 

Especially, There is one thing that I can not forget that is I drunk. So every girls made up for me. They draw the cat on my face. I could not stop laughing when the photos in the next morning.

That’s an awsome time for me. If you wanna find an place to recharge your power, you can hang out to many resort in Soc Son district.
